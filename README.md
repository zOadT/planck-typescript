Typescript definitions for [planck.js](https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js)

**NOTE:** This is WIP. As soon as the definition gets production ready, we will push it to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

Things to know:
 - Typescript `3.0` is required
 - Extending classes (like e.g. `planck.Joint`) is not supported
 - Currently also private methods are exposed

Any feedback or contribution would be appreciated.
