# planck-typescript
Typescript definitions for [planck.js](https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js).

This repository is obsolete. The definition file is now maintained in the [planck.js](https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js)-repository.

Things to know:
 - Typescript `3.0` is required
 - Extending classes (like e.g. `planck.Joint`) is not supported
 - Currently also private methods are exposed

Any feedback or contribution would be appreciated.
